      <h2><shadow>A Quick Note:</shadow></h2>
      <p style="padding-right:600px;">I don't judge a game based on the size of the studio or campare the studio's other games. I do however take gameplay, length, and price into account. I also only review games that fit genres I like, there's no point in rating a game that I wouldn't like regardless, it doesn't help others and is not "classy".</p>
      <p style="padding-right:600px">For those that have seen the increase of AAA games price going from 60$>>>70$, I strongly encourage looking into indie games. Not only are they cheaper on average, but the game is often more innovative and supports the individuals handcrafting them VS corporations.<br>
      Examples of great indie games include: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/" target="_blank">Celeste</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/" target="_blank">The Binding of Isaac</a>, 
      and even Toby Fox's  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/" target="_blank">Undertale</a>.</p>
      <p>The review will have a spoiler button if I deem any of the content a spoiler for the game's story.</p>

                          <p>Satisfactory is a first-person factory builder that puts you in an unknown planet with the goal of utilizing its lush resources to produce goods that can be used to progress and upgrade your factory. The visuals are very well done with a unique style that compliments it well. Just as you begin to reach your factory's limit a new resource becomes collectable and with it even more options for production. I do understand this sort of getting better just to be better isn't for everyone but I felt the relaxing tone it gave was a nice contrast to other games that require focus constantly. I could take hours just running around doing nothing while my minors automatically gathered iron and copper. Or I could plan out a new layout for an upcoming factory. Heck if trains are your thing you could automate a rail system and catch a ride back and forth as it moves materials from factory to factory.</p>

                          <p>It is very hard to review Inscyption without spoiling it, but I'll give it a shot. Similar to Undertale, Inscyption is best played blind. Waking up within a cabin, you must outplay the game master of sorts in a sacrifice based roguelike deckbuilder. You have to play weaker cards in your hand to offer enough blood to satisfy your heavy hitters. The story is rich and tells of something MUCH bigger happening behind the scenes. In order to get an understanding of the world you find yourself in, you must work alongside some special cards that have more than a mind of their own. At points you are demanded to get up from your game board and take a look around. Rather quickly you will discover that defeating the keeper of the cabin is only half the puzzle...</p>

                          <p>This game is a masterpiece, beautiful story, amazing sound, awesome visuals, outstanding game mechanics. The only thing keeping this game from a 10/10 is the sort of abandonment Titanfall has gone through, more on that later. The story is quite complex, but put simply </p>

                          <p>Undertale is a far more complex game that sends a larger message so my review is going to be much more in-depth and filled with spoilers. I strongly suggest playing the game (multiple times!) before looking at my review. Toby Fox's games are always best experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible.</p>

                          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                          <p>The gameplay spans from navigating beautiful landscapes that tell a story all in themselves to fierce bullet-hell like fights that has the player debating how long they can stay in a fight. (Last warning for spoilers!) Each fight lets the player decide if they would like to attack or spare the enemy, with no immediate way to know which one is easier. This leaves the player at a morale decision. As the game progresses the enemies' attacks get more intense and unique with switch ups coming from both sides of the battle. The heart you control to dodge attacks can be turned blue mid-fight against certain foes and now the player must adapt to a gravity platformer to avoid damage. The player will see more and more fights use different "souls" as the game progresses, all with special abilites that feel totally different feels.</p>
                          <h2>Story</h2>
                          <p>Not many games have a story with so much thought and personality as Undertale, and it's developed by one man with the help of some great individuals! A lot will be left out for simplicity because the game has many layers, I  am fully aware of some deeper meanings and meanings. The player takes the role of a human who has fallen down into a giant, sealed, underground world full of monsters. The player lands in the Ruins, an isolated part of the underground that is relatively calm. The caretaker of the Ruins is a humanoid goat who is eager to take care of those who are unfortunate enough to fall into the underground. Her motherly feel quickly turns into overprotection as the player makes their move to carry foward into the next area Snowdin.</p>
                          <p>Snowdin contains possibly the most recognizable faces in the game, Sans and Papyrus.</p>

                          <p>Enter the Gungeon might possibly be one of the silliest, most creative games I have played. The story sees you, a adventurer wanting to kill their past, finding odd firearms, flipping tables, and gunning down living bullets with guns of their own. While it's gameplay is grounded in "dodge stuff, shoot things", the way you do it feels awesome and unique. Every weapon and passive feels clever and special. Synergies keep things fresh. Bosses are difficult resulting in a great feeling upon finally defeating one. The graphics are pixel based which is backed by the visual gags and humor. The music matches the mood and atmosphere the game is presenting.</p>
